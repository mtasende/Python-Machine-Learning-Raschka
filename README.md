# Python-Machine-Learning-Raschka
These are the notebooks and other notes I got from Sebastian Raschka's book: "Python Machine Learning". Most of the code was directly copied by hand from the book (an underrated technique :P). This notebooks are not supposed to be original in any way. There is also a compilation of references in "referencias.pdf".
